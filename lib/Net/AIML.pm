=head1 NAME

Net::AIML - Perl interface to the Pandorabots.com AIML server

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.0.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    package Alice;
    use Net::AIML;
    use IO::Prompt;

    my $bot = Net::AIML->new( botid => be50f516be367d9d ); # Alice
    while (prompt "You: ") {
    	print "Alice: ".$bot->tell($_)."\n";
    }  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pandorabots.com provides an XMLRPC interface to their AIML server. This module wraps that interface 
into an easy Perl OO interface. 

=head1 INTERFACE

Net::AIML exports exactly two methods.

=over 

=item C< new >

The only important parameter currently being c< botid > which identifies the 
bot you wish to use on Pandorabots.com. You can get this botid from Pandorabots.

=item C< tell >

Given a line of text, tell returns the line returned by pandorabots. 

=back 

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
  
Net::AIML uses LWP internally. Any environment variables that LWP supports should be supported 
by Net::AIML. I hope.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over

=item L<HTTP::Request::Common>

=item L<LWP::Simple>

=item L<LWP::UserAgent>

=item L<XML::Smart>

=back

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES
